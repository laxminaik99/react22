1.Create one simple page with two buttons, provide an icon to the page when we run the page we should get the icon displayed to the tab or the window
we can try it by changing the icon , as run it again the new icon needs to be displayed. we will have multiple icon images taken.
Now we need to work out method that while we are on the page and click button number one the icon should change to different image.
Say for default you will see react icon to the page. now you have to assign one icon to button one and other icon to button number two.
On click of the button you should be able to change icon of the page.
